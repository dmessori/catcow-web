            <p>
              CatCow is a creative studio that brings bold stories and wild ideas to life
              through animation, design, and a whole lot of heart. We work with brands, agencies,
              and causes that dare to stand out.
            </p>

            <p>
              From quirky character animations to bold motion design, we embrace storytelling in all forms.
              Our team is a collective of artists, thinkers, makers, and dreamersâ€”spread across time zones,
              united by passion.
            </p>

            <p>
              We're not here to just make things pretty (though we do that too). We're here to connect,
              to move people, and to make magic through motion.
            </p>
