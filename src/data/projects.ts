      description: "We partnered with Vitalant to create a bold, emotionally driven animation that raises awareness about the urgent need for blood donations. Built around the powerful insight that “every two seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood,” the piece uses dynamic motion, quick transitions, and human-centered storytelling to connect with audiences and inspire action.",
